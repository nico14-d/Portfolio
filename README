# Hey, great to see you here!

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nicola, and I’m an engineer with a passion for data analysis. My career path has been quite unconventional – 
I started as a construction engineer and later transitioned into project management, overseeing multiple investment projects in the gas industry. 
Throughout my career, I’ve managed projects of various budgets, ranging from 20,000 – 250,000 PLN, with some exceeding 2,000,000 PLN.

I've always been fascinated by numbers, analysis, and making data-driven decisions. Last year, I decided to follow this passion and transition into the 
world of Data Analytics & Data Science. Since then, I’ve been actively learning new skills, completing courses, participating in internships, and working 
on real-world data projects.

To further enhance my expertise, I have enrolled in a postgraduate program in *Data Science: Advanced Data Analytics* at the Wrocław University of Economics.
