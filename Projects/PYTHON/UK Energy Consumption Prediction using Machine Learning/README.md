# UK Energy Consumption Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a predictive model for energy consumption in the United Kingdom, utilizing Python and machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately forecast energy consumption patterns based on a combination of historical data, weather information, and socio-economic indicators.

## Key Features & Technologies:

*   Data Cleaning & Transformation – Employed Pandas to clean and transform diverse datasets, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
*   Data Integration – Combined energy consumption statistics, weather data, and socio-economic indicators into a unified dataset.
*   Feature Engineering – Created relevant features from raw data, such as heating degree days, lagged energy consumption values, and demographic ratios.

## Core Analysis Components (Planned):

*   Exploratory Data Analysis – Examining trends, seasonality, and correlations in the data.
*   Predictive Modeling – Building and evaluating machine learning models to forecast energy consumption.
*   Model Evaluation – Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and validating predictions against real-world data.

This project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing energy consumption in the UK and demonstrate the potential of machine learning for energy forecasting and resource management.
