# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Cyclistic bike share data to identify trends in ridership patterns and provide data-driven recommendations for business growth and operational improvements. 
The analysis was conducted using R and various data visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights from a large dataset.

## Key Features & Technologies:

*   **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Used `tidyverse` package to clean and transform raw data, ensuring data quality and consistency.
*   **Data Aggregation & Analysis** – Calculated key metrics such as trip duration, start and end station popularity, and user demographics.
*   **Data Visualization** – Created insightful visualizations using `ggplot2` to identify patterns in ridership by time of day, day of week, and member type.
*   **Statistical Analysis** – Performed statistical analysis to compare the behavior of casual riders vs. members, uncovering key differences in their usage patterns.
*   **Geospatial Analysis** - Analysed data considering geographic features using `Geosphere` package to identify potential locations for expanding or optimizing station placement.

## Core Analysis Components:

*   **Rider Demographics** – Analyzed the distribution of riders by membership type (member vs. casual rider).
*   **Trip Duration Analysis** – Examined the distribution of trip durations and identified peak usage times.
*   **Start & End Station Analysis** – Determined the most popular start and end stations.
*   **Temporal Analysis** – Explored ridership patterns by time of day, day of week, and month.
*   **Comparative Analysis** – Compared the behavior of casual riders and members across various metrics.
*   **Geographic Analysis** - Examined usage across different stations using latitude/longitude coordinates and evaluated potential expansions.

This analysis serves as a **foundation for data-driven decision-making** for Cyclistic, providing insights to **optimize resource allocation, improve customer experience, 
and drive revenue growth.** It can be further extended with advanced analytics techniques and integration with external datasets.

**Note:** This project was one of my early data analysis endeavors. With my current knowledge and experience, I recognize that a more comprehensive analysis would benefit from additional steps, such as:

*   Calculating descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for key variables.
*   Identifying and handling outliers using techniques like boxplots and IQR.
*   Conducting a more thorough exploration of missing data.
*   Performing more advanced statistical tests to validate findings.

I view this project as a stepping stone in my data analysis journey and am continuously learning and improving my skills.
