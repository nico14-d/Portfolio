# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze historical trip data from Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, to identify key trends in ridership patterns and provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing their business strategy. The analysis is designed to answer the question of how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, with the ultimate goal of converting casual riders into members.

The project involves several stages: data collection, data cleaning and transformation, data analysis and visualization, and finally, deriving actionable insights. The analysis leverages the `tidyverse` package in R for data manipulation and the `ggplot2` package for creating compelling visualizations. Key areas of focus include trip duration analysis, start and end station analysis, temporal analysis (by time of day, day of week, and month), and comparative analysis between casual riders and members.

The findings of this analysis can be used to inform decisions related to pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, resource allocation, and station placement, ultimately helping Cyclistic to increase membership and improve overall operational efficiency.

## Key Features & Technologies:

*   **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Used `tidyverse` package to clean and transform raw data, ensuring data quality and consistency.
*   **Data Aggregation & Analysis** – Calculated key metrics such as trip duration, start and end station popularity, and user demographics.
*   **Data Visualization** – Created insightful visualizations using `ggplot2` to identify patterns in ridership by time of day, day of week, and member type.
*   **Statistical Analysis** – Performed statistical analysis to compare the behavior of casual riders vs. members, uncovering key differences in their usage patterns.
*   **Geospatial Analysis** - Analysed data considering geographic features using `Geosphere` package to identify potential locations for expanding or optimizing station placement.

## Core Analysis Components:

*   **Rider Demographics** – Analyzed the distribution of riders by membership type (member vs. casual rider).
*   **Trip Duration Analysis** – Examined the distribution of trip durations and identified peak usage times.
*   **Start & End Station Analysis** – Determined the most popular start and end stations.
*   **Temporal Analysis** – Explored ridership patterns by time of day, day of week, and month.
*   **Comparative Analysis** – Compared the behavior of casual riders and members across various metrics.
*   **Geographic Analysis** - Examined usage across different stations using latitude/longitude coordinates and evaluated potential expansions.

This analysis serves as a **foundation for data-driven decision-making** for Cyclistic, providing insights to **optimize resource allocation, improve customer experience, 
and drive revenue growth.** It can be further extended with advanced analytics techniques and integration with external datasets.

**Note:** This project was one of my early data analysis endeavors. With my current knowledge and experience, I recognize that a more comprehensive analysis would benefit from additional steps, such as:

*   Calculating descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for key variables.
*   Identifying and handling outliers using techniques like boxplots and IQR.
*   Conducting a more thorough exploration of missing data.
*   Performing more advanced statistical tests to validate findings.

I view this project as a stepping stone in my data analysis journey and am continuously learning and improving my skills.
