# MuseumDB: Mini Database for Museum Management


## Project Overview

This project presents a mini relational database for museum management. 
The primary goal was to design a conceptual, logical, and physical model and implement a fully functional PostgreSQL database that efficiently manages museum collections and exhibits.

## Key Features & Technologies:

- Conceptual, Logical & Physical Modeling – Database structure optimized for museum data storage.
- PostgreSQL Implementation – Tables, relationships, constraints, PKs & FKs.
- Data Integrity & Duplication Control – Constraints and unique checks for data consistency.
- Dynamic Data Population – SQL scripts that prevent duplicates and ensure referential integrity.
- Stored Functions & Queries – Additional SQL functions for museum-related operations.

## Core Database Components:

    Artifacts – List of museum exhibits with descriptions and historical details.
    Collections – Groups of related artifacts curated by the museum.
    Exhibitions – Temporary or permanent museum exhibitions.
    Visitors & Tickets – Information on museum guests and ticket purchases.
    Staff & Roles – Employee database with assigned roles.
    Functions & Queries – Custom SQL functions for museum operations.
