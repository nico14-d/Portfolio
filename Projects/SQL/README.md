# SQL Projects

This section showcases my proficiency in SQL, demonstrating my ability to design and implement relational databases, write efficient queries, and manage data effectively.

## Projects

### OutdoorConnect: Social Media Database for Outdoor Enthusiasts

This project showcases the design and implementation of a fully relational database for a social media platform dedicated to outdoor sports enthusiasts. Starting from the conceptual model, the database was designed from scratch and implemented as a functional PostgreSQL database to manage user interactions and events.

**Key Features & Technologies:**

*   Conceptual, Logical & Physical Model Design – Structured entity relationships to model a realistic social media platform.
*   PostgreSQL Implementation – Full schema definition, including tables, data types, constraints, primary & foreign keys.
*   Data Integrity & Normalization – Optimized data relationships with constraints, uniqueness rules, and cascading deletes.
*   Dynamic Data Insertion & Security – SQL scripts ensure efficient data population while preventing duplicates.
*   Scalability & Social Media Features – Supports user profiles, activities, events, friend connections, groups, posts, comments, and reactions.

**Core Database Components:**

*   Users – Allows users to register and connect with other outdoor enthusiasts.
*   Activities – Manages a list of outdoor activities users can engage in.
*   Groups & Memberships – Facilitates social groups dedicated to different activities and regions.
*   Events & Participants – Enables users to create outdoor events and track participants.
*   Posts & Comments – Provides a platform for users to share experiences, images, and thoughts in dedicated groups.
*   Reactions & Friendships – Supports social interactions such as likes and friendships.
*   Messaging System – Implements direct messaging between users.
*   Notifications – Delivers alerts for friend requests, event invites, and new group activity.

### MuseumDB: Mini Database for Museum Management

This project presents a mini relational database for museum management. The primary goal was to design a conceptual, logical, and physical model and implement a fully functional PostgreSQL database that efficiently manages museum collections and exhibits.

**Key Features & Technologies:**

*   PostgreSQL Database Implementation – Includes well-defined tables, relationships, constraints, primary & foreign keys.
*   Inventory & Exhibition Management – Tracks historical items and associates them with museum exhibitions.
*   Employee & Curator Records – Stores information about museum staff, such as curators and guides.
*   Visitor & Ticketing System – Manages ticket purchases and visitor attendance using a relational model.
*   Data Integrity & Duplication Control – Implements constraints and validation rules to ensure consistency.
*   Stored Functions & Queries – Custom SQL procedures for data updates and ticket transactions.

**Core Database Components:**

*   Inventory - Museum collection with acquisition details and estimated value.
*   Exhibitions - Thematic displays of artifacts with curator assignments.
*   Exhibition Items - Bridge table linking exhibits with their respective exhibitions.
*   Employees - Museum staff database, including curators and other personnel.
*   Visitors & Tickets - System for tracking ticket purchases and visitor attendance.
*   SQL Functions - Custom stored procedures for updating records and managing transactions.

### Data Warehouse Project (Under Development)

This is my most ambitious SQL project currently under development.  It focuses on designing and implementing a fully functional data warehouse solution, including:

*   **Data Modeling:**  Designing a star schema/snowflake schema.
*   **ETL Processes:** Building robust ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load data from various sources.
*   **DDL & DML Scripting:**  Creating and populating database tables using SQL scripts.
*   **Data Quality:**  Implementing data quality checks and validation rules to ensure data accuracy.

More details will be added soon as development progresses.
