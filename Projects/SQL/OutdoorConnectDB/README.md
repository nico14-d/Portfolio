## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a fully relational database for a social media platform dedicated to outdoor sports enthusiasts, such as hiking, skiing, climbing, and downhill biking. The database was designed from scratch, starting with the conceptual model, followed by a logical model, and finally implemented as a fully functional physical database in PostgreSQL.


## Key Features & Technologies:

- Conceptual, Logical & Physical Model Design – Structured entity relationships to model a realistic social media platform.
- PostgreSQL Implementation – Full schema definition, including tables, data types, constraints, PKs, and FKs.
- Data Integrity & Normalization – Ensured optimized data relationships with constraints, uniqueness rules, and cascading deletes.
- Dynamic Data Insertion & Security – SQL scripts ensure efficient data population while preventing duplicates.
- Scalability & Social Media Features – Supports user profiles, activities, events, friend connections, groups, posts, comments, and reactions.


## Core Database Components:

    Users – Register and connect with other outdoor enthusiasts.
    Activities – List of outdoor activities users can engage in.
    Groups & Memberships – Social groups dedicated to different activities and regions.
    Events & Participants – Outdoor events created by users, with participant tracking.
    Posts & Comments – Users can share their experiences, images, and thoughts in dedicated groups.
    Reactions & Friendships – Social interactions such as likes and friendships.
    Messaging System – Direct messages between users.
    Notifications – Alerts for friend requests, event invites, and new group activity.
