# OutdoorConnect: Social Media Database for Outdoor Enthusiasts

## Project Overview

This project showcases the design and implementation of a fully relational database for a social media platform dedicated to outdoor sports enthusiasts. Starting from the conceptual model, the database was designed from scratch and implemented as a functional PostgreSQL database to manage user interactions and events.

## Key Features & Technologies:

-   **Conceptual, Logical & Physical Model Design** – Structured entity relationships to model a realistic social media platform.
-   **PostgreSQL Implementation** – Full schema definition, including tables, data types, constraints, primary & foreign keys.
-   **Data Integrity & Normalization** – Optimized data relationships with constraints, uniqueness rules, and cascading deletes.
-   **Dynamic Data Insertion & Security** – SQL scripts ensure efficient data population while preventing duplicates.
-   **Scalability & Social Media Features** – Supports user profiles, activities, events, friend connections, groups, posts, comments, and reactions.

## Core Database Components:

-   Users – Allows users to register and connect with other outdoor enthusiasts.
-   Activities – Manages a list of outdoor activities users can engage in.
-   Groups & Memberships – Facilitates social groups dedicated to different activities and regions.
-   Events & Participants – Enables users to create outdoor events and track participants.
-   Posts & Comments – Provides a platform for users to share experiences, images, and thoughts in dedicated groups.
-   Reactions & Friendships – Supports social interactions such as likes and friendships.
-   Messaging System – Implements direct messaging between users.
-   Notifications – Delivers alerts for friend requests, event invites, and new group activity.

This model serves as a **foundation for a scalable social media platform**. It can be **extended with features** such as advanced search, location-based services, and integration with external APIs to enhance user engagement.
