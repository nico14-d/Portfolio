# DVDRental: SQL Queries for Rental Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project contains SQL queries based on the DVDRental database. The goal is to analyze and extract meaningful insights from rental data, showcasing expertise in data retrieval, aggregation, and reporting using SQL.


## Key Features & Technologies:

- PostgreSQL Database Queries – Structured queries leveraging joins, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), and window functions.
- Movie & Rental Analysis – Queries for examining rental revenue, popular movies, and customer rental habits.
- Employee Performance Evaluation – Identifies top-performing employees based on rental revenue contributions.
- Customer & Genre Insights – Retrieves information about customer preferences and rental trends across different film genres.
- Data Aggregation & Filtering – Uses GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY to summarize key insights.
- Handling NULL Values & Data Formatting – Ensures robust data processing with techniques such as COALESCE and STRING_AGG.


## Core SQL Queries:

- Movie Analysis: Retrieves animated movies from 2017-2019 with high ratings.
- Revenue Insights: Calculates rental store revenue since March 2017.
- Actor Popularity: Lists the top 5 actors by the number of movies since 2015.
- Genre Trends: Analyzes the number of Drama, Travel, and Documentary films per year.
- Customer Rentals: Aggregates rented horror films per customer and total spend.
- Employee Performance: Identifies the top 3 revenue-generating employees in 2017.
- Popular Rentals: Lists the top 5 most rented movies and estimates audience age.
- Actor Career Gaps: Determines actors with the longest inactivity periods.

## How to Run the Scripts?

The queries are designed for PostgreSQL and can be executed in any SQL environment that supports PostgreSQL syntax.

- Ensure the dvdrental database is available.
- Use a database management tool such as pgAdmin, DBeaver, or psql.
- Execute the required SQL script to generate insights.
