This section showcases my academic background and research experience, demonstrating my analytical skills and ability to tackle complex engineering problems.

## Bachelor's Thesis: Analysis of Sluice Gate Capacity for Irrigation Water Intakes

This research focused on analyzing the capacity of sluice gates used in irrigation water intakes. The study involved collecting and analyzing data from a laboratory model using two different methodologies (Polish and US-based).  The main finding highlighted the challenges in determining a fixed location for water level measurement that accurately reflects the real flow rate. However, the research did establish a strong correlation between water depth, discharge, and characteristic depths of the lower water, which allows for the determination of the expenditure of the tested structure.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:** Data Collection, Data Analysis, Hydraulic Modeling, Statistical Analysis, Report Writing

**Keywords:** Sluice Gate, Flow Rate, Irrigation, Hydraulic Analysis

## Master's Thesis: Effective Numerical Methods for Solving Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations Describing Transient Gas Flow

This thesis explored the application of numerical methods to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations that model transient gas flow. The research focused on analyzing various hydraulic models based on momentum, energy, and continuity equations, with the goal of developing a general scheme for solving these equations using the method of characteristics and several implicit methods. The work highlights the importance of numerical methods in accurately modelling gas flow in networks for proper operation and future expansion.
