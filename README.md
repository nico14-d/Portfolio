# Nicola DudziÅ„ski Portfolio

## About Me
Hey, great to see you here!

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nicola, and Iâ€™m an engineer with a passion for data analysis and problem-solving. My career path has been quite unconventional â€“ I started as a construction engineer and later transitioned into project management, leading multiple investment projects in the gas industry. I had the opportunity to manage various projects, including large-scale initiatives co-financed by the European Union.

I have always been fascinated by numbers, patterns, and data-driven decision-making. Whether optimizing workflows, analyzing project efficiency, or finding insights in complex datasets, I found myself naturally drawn to analytical challenges. This passion led me to transition into Data Analytics & Data Science, where I could fully leverage my technical background and problem-solving skills.

Since making this shift, I have been actively expanding my expertiseâ€”completing specialized courses, working on real-world data projects, and gaining hands-on experience with SQL, Python, and statistical modeling. To deepen my knowledge even further, I have enrolled in a postgraduate program in Data Science: Advanced Data Analytics at the WrocÅ‚aw University of Economics.

### Why Data?

I enjoy the process of extracting valuable insights from raw data, transforming complex information into meaningful solutions. Whether through statistical analysis, machine learning models, or data visualization, I thrive on uncovering patterns that drive better decision-making.

### Key Strengths

- **Strong technical background & analytical thinking** â€“ I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Gas Engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology.
- **Teaching complex concepts in a simple way** â€“ 10+ years of experience teaching Fluid Mechanics at the academic level, helping students grasp complex technical concepts.
- **Continuous learning & development** â€“ Hands-on experience gained from self-driven projects and Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, constantly refining my skills.

### Beyond Data

Outside of analytics, Iâ€™m passionate about hiking in the mountains, practicing calisthenics, and exploring new technologies. I also love reading popular science books and watching snooker matches, analyzing player strategies just as I would a dataset.
