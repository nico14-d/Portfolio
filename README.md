# Nicola Dudziński Portfolio

## About Me
Hey, great to see you here!

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nicola, and I’m an engineer with a passion for data analysis and problem-solving. My career path has been quite unconventional – I started as a construction engineer and later transitioned into project management, leading multiple investment projects in the gas industry. I had the opportunity to manage various projects, including large-scale initiatives co-financed by the European Union.

I have always been fascinated by numbers, patterns, and data-driven decision-making. Whether optimizing workflows, analyzing project efficiency, or finding insights in complex datasets, I found myself naturally drawn to analytical challenges. This passion led me to transition into Data Analytics & Data Science, where I could fully leverage my technical background and problem-solving skills.

Since making this shift, I have been actively expanding my expertise—completing specialized courses, working on real-world data projects, and gaining hands-on experience with SQL, Python, and statistical modeling. To deepen my knowledge even further, I have enrolled in a postgraduate program in Data Science: Advanced Data Analytics at the Wrocław University of Economics.

<br>

### Why Data?

I enjoy the process of extracting valuable insights from raw data, transforming complex information into meaningful solutions. Whether through statistical analysis, machine learning models, or data visualization, I thrive on uncovering patterns that drive better decision-making.

<br>

### Key Strengths

*   **Strong analytical thinking & problem-solving skills:** I possess a strong foundation in analytical thinking, honed through my Master's degree in Gas Engineering and extensive experience in project management. I enjoy tackling complex problems, identifying patterns in data, and developing data-driven solutions. My passion for optimization and attention to detail allow me to identify opportunities for improvement and drive efficiency in various processes.

*   **Data-driven decision-making:** I am passionate about leveraging data to inform decision-making and drive business outcomes. I have a proven track record of analyzing complex datasets, identifying key insights, and translating them into actionable strategies. Whether it's optimizing workflows, improving project efficiency, or identifying new market opportunities, I believe that data-driven decision-making is essential for success.

*   **Teamwork & leadership skills:** I have extensive experience working in collaborative environments and leading teams on large-scale projects. I am a strong communicator, adept at building relationships, and skilled at motivating team members to achieve common goals. I am also highly responsible and committed to delivering high-quality results on time and within budget.

*   **Teaching complex concepts in a simple way:** 10+ years of experience teaching Fluid Mechanics at the academic level, helping students grasp complex technical concepts. This experience has honed my ability to communicate technical information clearly and concisely to both technical and non-technical audiences.

*   **Continuous learning & development:** Hands-on experience gained from self-driven projects and Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, constantly refining my skills. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in data analytics and data science.

<br>

### Beyond Data

Outside of analytics, I’m passionate about hiking in the mountains, practicing calisthenics, and exploring new technologies. I also love reading popular science books and watching snooker matches, analyzing player strategies just as I would a dataset.

## **Projects**

[Direct link to Project Folder](https://github.com/nico14-d/Portfolio/tree/main/Projects)

#### **SQL**

  - #### OutdoorConnect: Social Media Database for Outdoor Enthusiasts

    **Problem:** Existing social media platforms lack specific features for outdoor sports enthusiasts, making it difficult to connect with like-minded individuals and organize activities.

    **Solution:** Developed a fully relational database to manage user profiles, outdoor events, groups, and activities, creating a dedicated social platform for outdoor enthusiasts.

  - #### ActiveGear: Data Warehouse (DWH) for ActiveGear, a sporting goods retailer

    **Problem:** ActiveGear lacks a centralized and structured data repository for analyzing sales data across online and in-store channels.
                  This limits the ability to identify key trends, understand customer behavior, and make data-driven decisions regarding product offerings, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation.
                  Existing data is scattered across different systems, making it difficult to perform comprehensive analysis and reporting.

    **Solution:** Developed a Data Warehouse (DWH) solution that consolidates data from online and in-store sales sources into a structured Dimensional Model (Star Schema).
                  The DWH includes automated ETL processes for data extraction, transformation, and loading, along with a custom logging mechanism for monitoring data quality and performance.
                  The solution enables ActiveGear to perform in-depth sales data analysis, identify key business insights, and optimize decision-making processes across the organization.
